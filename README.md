        This project is an implementation of a distributed systems tool in Go. It's designed to simulate and manage distributed computing tasks across multiple nodes.

        ## Getting Started
        - Ensure Go is installed on your machine.
        - Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
        - Run `go build` to compile the project.
        - Start the distributed system by running the compiled binary.

        ## Features
        - Distributed computing framework for task distribution.
        - Node management for adding and removing nodes.
        - Task scheduling and load balancing.
        - Fault tolerance mechanisms.
        - Node-to-node communication protocol.

        ## Usage
        Detailed instructions on how to set up and use the system are provided in the documentation.

        ## Testing
        Run `go test` to execute tests.

        ## Contributing
